# Secure hashing algorithm used for computing the 'os_hash_value' property.
#
# This option configures the Glance "multihash", which consists of two
# image properties: the 'os_hash_algo' and the 'os_hash_value'.  The
# 'os_hash_algo' will be populated by the value of this configuration
# option, and the 'os_hash_value' will be populated by the hexdigest computed
# when the algorithm is applied to the uploaded or imported image data.
#
# The value must be a valid secure hash algorithm name recognized by the
# python 'hashlib' library.  You can determine what these are by examining
# the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the
# library being used in your Glance installation.  For interoperability
# purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash
# names supplied by the 'hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed' data member because
# those algorithms are guaranteed to be supported by the 'hashlib' library
# on all platforms.  Thus, any image consumer using 'hashlib' locally should
# be able to verify the 'os_hash_value' of the image.
#
# The default value of 'sha512' is a performant secure hash algorithm.
#
# If this option is misconfigured, any attempts to store image data will fail.

# cached images, fetch size of the cache, queue images for caching and clean up
# the cache, etc.
#
# The essential functions of a driver are defined in the base class
# ``glance.image_cache.drivers.base.Driver``. All image-cache drivers (existing
# and prospective) must implement this interface. Currently available drivers
# are ``sqlite`` and ``xattr``. These drivers primarily differ in the way they
# store the information about cached images:
#
# * The ``centralized_db`` driver uses a central database (which will be common
#   for all glance nodes) to track the usage of cached images.
# * The ``sqlite`` (deprecated) driver uses a sqlite database (which sits on
#   every glance node locally) to track the usage of cached images.
# * The ``xattr`` driver uses the extended attributes of files to store this
#   information. It also requires a filesystem that sets ``atime`` on the files
#   when accessed.

# cache can far exceed the size specified here very easily. Hence, care must be
# taken to appropriately schedule the cache-pruner and in setting this limit.
#
# Glance caches an image when it is downloaded. Consequently, the size of the

# cache size from becoming unmanageable, it is recommended to run the
# cache-pruner as a periodic task. When the cache pruner is kicked off, it

#
# The ``incomplete`` subdirectory is the staging area for downloading images. An
# image is first downloaded to this directory. When the image download is
# successful it is moved to the base directory. However, if the download fails,
# the partially downloaded image file is moved to the ``invalid`` subdirectory.
#
# The ``queue``subdirectory is used for queuing images for download. This is
# used primarily by the cache-prefetcher, which can be scheduled as a periodic
# task like cache-pruner and cache-cleaner, to cache images ahead of their
# usage.
# Upon receiving the request to cache an image, Glance touches a file in the
# ``queue`` directory with the image id as the file name. The cache-prefetcher,
# when running, polls for the files in ``queue`` directory and starts
# downloading them in the order they were created. When the download is

# The datastores where the image can be stored.
#
# This configuration option specifies the datastores where the image can
# be stored in the VMWare store backend. This option may be specified
# multiple times for specifying multiple datastores. The datastore name
# should be specified after its datacenter path, separated by ":". An
# optional weight may be given after the datastore name, separated again
# by ":" to specify the priority. Thus, the required format becomes
# <datacenter_path>:<datastore_name>:<optional_weight>.
#
# When adding an image, the datastore with highest weight will be
# selected, unless there is not enough free space available in cases
# where the image size is already known. If no weight is given, it is
# assumed to be zero and the directory will be considered for selection
# last. If multiple datastores have the same weight, then the one with
# the most free space available is selected.
#
# Possible Values:
#     * Any string of the format:
#       <datacenter_path>:<datastore_name>:<optional_weight>
#
# Related options:
#    * None

# enable this flag along with the ``enforce_scope`` flag so that you can get the
# benefits of new defaults and ``scope_type`` together. If ``False``, the
