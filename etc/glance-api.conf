# for providing the essential functions of image-cache like write images to/read
# images from cache, track age and usage of cached images, provide a list of
# cached images, fetch size of the cache, queue images for caching and clean up
# the cache, etc.
#
# The essential functions of a driver are defined in the base class
# ``glance.image_cache.drivers.base.Driver``. All image-cache drivers (existing
# and prospective) must implement this interface. Currently available drivers
# are ``sqlite`` and ``xattr``. These drivers primarily differ in the way they
# store the information about cached images:
#     * The ``sqlite`` driver uses a sqlite database (which sits on every glance
#     node locally) to track the usage of cached images.
#     * The ``xattr`` driver uses the extended attributes of files to store this
#     information. It also requires a filesystem that sets ``atime`` on the

#
# NOTE: This is just a threshold for cache-pruner to act upon. It is NOT a

# on how often the cache-pruner runs and how quickly the cache fills, the image
# cache can far exceed the size specified here very easily. Hence, care must be
# taken to appropriately schedule the cache-pruner and in setting this limit.
#
# Glance caches an image when it is downloaded. Consequently, the size of the
# image cache grows over time as the number of downloads increases. To keep the
# cache size from becoming unmanageable, it is recommended to run the
# cache-pruner as a periodic task. When the cache pruner is kicked off, it
# compares the current size of image cache and triggers a cleanup if the image
# cache grew beyond the size specified here. After the cleanup, the size of

# Base directory for image cache.
#
# This is the location where image data is cached and served out of. All cached
# images are stored directly under this directory. This directory also contains
# three subdirectories, namely, ``incomplete``, ``invalid`` and ``queue``.
#
# The ``incomplete`` subdirectory is the staging area for downloading images. An
# image is first downloaded to this directory. When the image download is
# successful it is moved to the base directory. However, if the download fails,
# the partially downloaded image file is moved to the ``invalid`` subdirectory.
#
# The ``queue``subdirectory is used for queuing images for download. This is
# used primarily by the cache-prefetcher, which can be scheduled as a periodic
# task like cache-pruner and cache-cleaner, to cache images ahead of their
# usage.
# Upon receiving the request to cache an image, Glance touches a file in the
# ``queue`` directory with the image id as the file name. The cache-prefetcher,
# when running, polls for the files in ``queue`` directory and starts
# downloading them in the order they were created. When the download is
# successful, the zero-sized file is deleted from the ``queue`` directory.
# If the download fails, the zero-sized file remains and it'll be retried the
