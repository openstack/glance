# Allow users to add additional/custom properties to images.
#
# Glance defines a standard set of properties (in its schema) that
# appear on every image. These properties are also known as
# ``base properties``. In addition to these properties, Glance
# allows users to add custom properties to images. These are known
# as ``additional properties``.
#
# By default, this configuration option is set to ``True`` and users
# are allowed to add additional properties. The number of additional
# properties that can be added to an image can be controlled via
# ``image_property_quota`` configuration option.
#
# Possible values:
#     * True
#     * False

# This option is deprecated for removal since Ussuri.
# Its value may be silently ignored in the future.

# to be removed during the Victoria development cycle.

# Secure hashing algorithm used for computing the 'os_hash_value' property.
#
# This option configures the Glance "multihash", which consists of two
# image properties: the 'os_hash_algo' and the 'os_hash_value'.  The
# 'os_hash_algo' will be populated by the value of this configuration
# option, and the 'os_hash_value' will be populated by the hexdigest computed
# when the algorithm is applied to the uploaded or imported image data.
#
# The value must be a valid secure hash algorithm name recognized by the
# python 'hashlib' library.  You can determine what these are by examining
# the 'hashlib.algorithms_available' data member of the version of the
# library being used in your Glance installation.  For interoperability
# purposes, however, we recommend that you use the set of secure hash
# names supplied by the 'hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed' data member because
# those algorithms are guaranteed to be supported by the 'hashlib' library
# on all platforms.  Thus, any image consumer using 'hashlib' locally should
# be able to verify the 'os_hash_value' of the image.
#
# The default value of 'sha512' is a performant secure hash algorithm.
#
# If this option is misconfigured, any attempts to store image data will fail.
# For that reason, we recommend using the default value.

# optional weight may be given after the datastore name, separated again
# by ":" to specify the priority. Thus, the required format becomes
# <datacenter_path>:<datastore_name>:<optional_weight>.
#
# When adding an image, the datastore with highest weight will be
# selected, unless there is not enough free space available in cases
# where the image size is already known. If no weight is given, it is
# assumed to be zero and the directory will be considered for selection
# last. If multiple datastores have the same weight, then the one with
# the most free space available is selected.
