# Allow users to add additional/custom properties to images.
#
# Glance defines a standard set of properties (in its schema) that

# ``base properties``. In addition to these properties, Glance
# allows users to add custom properties to images. These are known
# as ``additional properties``.
#
# By default, this configuration option is set to ``True`` and users
# are allowed to add additional properties. The number of additional
# properties that can be added to an image can be controlled via
