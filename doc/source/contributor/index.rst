Glance Contribution Guidelines
==============================

In the Contributions Guide, you will find documented policies for
developing with Glance. This includes the processes we use for
blueprints and specs, bugs, contributor onboarding, core reviewer
memberships, and other procedural items.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Additional documentation on Glance and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org>`_.
