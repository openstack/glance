==================
Basic architecture
==================

OpenStack Glance has a client-server architecture that provides a REST API to
the user through which requests to the server can be performed.

A Glance Domain Controller manages the internal server operations that is divided
into layers. A specific task is implemented by each layer.

All the file (Image data) operations are performed using glance_store library, that
is responsible for interaction with external storage back ends and (or) local filesystem(s).
In turn, it provides a uniform interface to access the backend stores.

Glance uses a central database (Glance DB) that is shared amongst all the components in the system
and is sql-based by default. Other types of database backends are somewhat supported and
used by operators but are not extensively tested upstream.

Following components are present in the Glance architecture:

* **A client** - any application that makes use of a Glance server.

* **REST API** - Glance functionalities are exposed via REST.

* **Database Abstraction Layer (DAL)** - an application programming interface(API) that unifies the communication between Glance and databases.

* **Glance Domain Controller** - acts as a middleware used to implement the main Glance functionalities such as authorization, notifications, policies,database connections.

* **Glance Store** - used to organize interactions between Glance and various data stores.

* **Registry Layer** - optional layer that is used to organise secure communication between the domain and the DAL by using a separate service.
