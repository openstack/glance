  - Deprecate the ``show_multiple_locations`` configuration
    option in favor of the existing Role Based Access
    Control (RBAC) for Image locations which uses
    ``policy.json`` file to define the appropriate rules.

    Some additional points about ``show_multiple_locations``
    configuration option deprecation.

    * Maintaining two different ways to configure, enable
      and/or disable a feature is painful for developers and
      operators, so the less granular means of controlling
      this feature will be eliminated in the **Ocata**
      release.
    * For the Newton release, this option will still be
      honored. However, it is important to update
      ``policy.json`` file for glance-api nodes. In
      particular, please consider updating the policies
      ``delete_image_location``, ``get_image_location`` and
      ``set_image_location`` as per your requirements. As
      this is an advanced option and prone to expose some
      risks, please check the policies to ensure security
      and privacy of your cloud.
    * Future releases will ignore this option and just
      follow the policy rules. It is recommended that this
      option is disabled for public endpoints and is used
      only internally for service-to-service communication.
    * As mentioned above, the same recommendation applies
      to the policy-based configuration for exposing
      multiple image locations.
