    Enhanced the custom property schema file (``schema-image.json``) to
    support an extended format that allows operators to define required
    properties. The schema file now supports a structured format with
    ``properties`` and ``required`` keys::

      {
          "properties": {
              "os_distro": {
                  "description": "Operating system distribution",
                  "type": "string"
              },
              "architecture": {
                  "description": "Operating system architecture",
                  "type": "string"
              }
          },
          "required": ["os_distro", "architecture"]
      }

    When using this extended format, properties listed in the ``required``
    array will be validated as mandatory fields during image creation. This
    allows operators to enforce that specific custom properties are provided
    when images are created, improving data quality and consistency.

    Backwards compatibility is fully maintained. The original flat format
    (with property definitions at the top level) continues to work as before,
    and existing ``schema-image.json`` files do not need to be modified. The
    schema loading logic automatically detects which format is being used.

    A sample extended format schema file is provided at
    ``etc/schema-image.json.extended-format-sample``.
